## Results

### Stock Performance between 2017 and 2018
Overall, 2017 was a better year for these green stocks. With the exception of TERP all of the stocks analyzed had a positive return. In 2018, only two stocks ENPH and RUN had a positive return. Based on this theses are the two stocks I would recommend investing in. To diversify further both SEDG and VSLR had small 2018 losses and large 2017 gains. These may also be strong stocks to invest in.

## Summary

### Advantages or Disadvantages
Refactoring code allows it to be quicker and more efficient. This matters significantly in high volume or time senstive situations. Having an inefficent code will require more resouces from the computer. If there is situation where there are hundreds of thousads of data points being analyzed the inefficentcy could be a difference of several minutes rather than a fraction of a second. In stock trading this could make a differnce in being able to make a transaction at the moment that it would be the most profitable. 
However, Anytime new code is introduced or current code is changed, it increases the opportunity to introduce human error. Some errors may cause the code to stop working completely. Other errors may be harder to identify as the code continues to work however it is not resulting in the desired outcome.
